    <h2>WEB</h2>
    <p>
      The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system<br>
      where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/),<br>
      which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.<br>
      The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),<br>
      may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.<br>
      The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,<br>
      which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
