    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.<br>
      CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
      This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, <br>
      enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate.<br>
      css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .<br>
      css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
